# BERT Representational Distance of Homonyms by Word Class

A computational analysis of representational distance between noun-noun homonyms, noun-verb homonyms, and unambiguous words using BERT embeddings. 
This project replicates and extends the methodology from **Mirman et al. (2010)** to assess semantic similarity based on contextual embeddings.
